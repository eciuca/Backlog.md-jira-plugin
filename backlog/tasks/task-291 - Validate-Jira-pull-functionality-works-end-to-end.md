## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Now that the Backlog CLI subprocess path issue is fixed, validate that the full Jira pull workflow functions correctly from start to finish.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Jira issue S20-291 can be successfully fetched via MCP
- [x] #2 Task task-289 mapping exists and is valid
- [x] #3 Pull command successfully updates task-289 with Jira data
- [x] #4 All task fields (title, description, status, assignee) sync correctly
- [x] #5 No errors occur during the pull operation
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Verify MCP Atlassian server is running and accessible
2. Check that task-289 -> S20-291 mapping exists in .backlog-jira/mappings.json
3. Run backlog-jira pull task-289 (without --dry-run)
4. Verify task-289 is updated with data from Jira issue S20-291
5. Check that all fields synced correctly (title, description, status, assignee, labels)
6. Verify sync state is recorded in .backlog-jira/state.db
7. Document any issues or improvements needed

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
## Validation Complete

Successfully validated the full Jira pull workflow from start to finish.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Database Column Name Mismatch
**Problem**: SQLite returns snake_case column names (jira_key, backlog_id) but TypeScript interface expected camelCase (jiraKey, backlogId).

**Solution**: Updated getMapping() and getMappingByJiraKey() in store.ts to properly transform snake_case to camelCase.

### 2. MCP Response Format Mismatch  
**Problem**: Expected Jira data under a "fields" property, but MCP Atlassian server returns flat structure.

**Solution**: Updated jira_get_issue response parsing in jira.ts to handle flat response structure (summary, description, status at top level).

### 3. Missing issue_type Field
**Problem**: MCP response doesn't include issue_type by default.\n\n**Solution**: Made issue_type optional with default value \"Task\".\n\n### 4. SQL Parameter Count Mismatch\n**Problem**: updateSyncState() SQL needed values duplicated for both INSERT and UPDATE clauses.\n\n**Solution**: Changed args array to include values twice: [backlogId, ...values, ...values].\n\n## Test Results\n\n✅ AC #1: Jira issue S20-291 successfully fetched via MCP\n✅ AC #2: Task-289 -> S20-291 mapping exists and is valid  \n✅ AC #3: Pull command successfully updated task-289\n✅ AC #4: All fields synced correctly (title, description, status, assignee, priority, labels)\n✅ AC #5: No errors during pull operation\n\n## Files Modified\n\n- backlog-jira/src/state/store.ts - Fixed getMapping methods and updateSyncState SQL\n- backlog-jira/src/integrations/jira.ts - Fixed MCP response parsing for jira_get_issue\n\n## Verification\n\nTask-289 successfully updated with:\n- Title: \"Print Delivery bill for Pallet Transfers\" (from Jira)\n- Description: Full description with image references (from Jira)\n- Priority: Medium (from Jira)\n- Assignee: Unassigned (from Jira)\n- Labels: [] (from Jira)\n\nSync state recorded in database with timestamps.
