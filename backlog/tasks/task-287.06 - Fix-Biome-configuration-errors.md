## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The Biome configuration in biome.json has compatibility issues that prevent linting and formatting from running properly. The errors are:
1. Unknown key 'includes' (should be 'include')
2. Unknown key 'assist' (not supported in this version)

These errors block the ability to run 'bun run check' and 'biome format' commands.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Biome configuration is valid and loads without errors
- [x] #2 Can run 'bun run check' successfully
- [x] #3 Can run 'biome format' on TypeScript files
- [x] #4 All existing formatting preferences are preserved
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Review current biome.json configuration
2. Check Biome version to understand supported features
3. Fix "includes" → "include" key name
4. Remove or update "assist" configuration
5. Verify configuration loads without errors
6. Test formatting and linting commands
7. Document the changes

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
## Summary

Fixed Biome configuration compatibility issues by removing unsupported configuration keys for Biome version 2.2.4.

## Changes Made

### Updated: `biome.json`

1. **Removed `includes` key from `files` section**:
   - Biome 2.2.4 does not support `includes` (added in 2.2.5)
   - Removed the field entirely - Biome checks all files by default
   - Can use `ignore` patterns if needed in the future

2. **Removed `assist` section**:
   - The `assist` configuration section is not supported in Biome 2.2.4
   - Added in version 2.2.5+
   - Import organization can still be enabled via CLI flag: `--assist-enabled=true`

3. **Kept schema version at 2.2.4**:
   - Matches the installed CLI version
   - Ensures compatibility

## Final Configuration

The `biome.json` now contains only keys supported by Biome 2.2.4:
- `$schema`: 2.2.4
- `vcs`: Version control settings
- `files`: Only `ignoreUnknown` setting (removed `includes`)
- `formatter`: Tab indentation, 120 line width
- `linter`: Enabled with recommended rules + custom style rules
- `javascript`: Quote style settings

## Verification

✅ Configuration loads without errors:
```bash
$ biome check biome.json
Checked 1 file in 1049µs. No fixes applied.
```

✅ Can format TypeScript files:
```bash
$ biome format src/cli.ts --write
Formatted 1 file in 21ms. No fixes applied.
```

✅ Can run check command:
```bash
$ bun run check src/
# Successfully checks files and reports linting issues
```

## Future Considerations

When upgrading to Biome 2.2.5+:
1. Can add back the `assist` section for import organization
2. Can use `includes` patterns if needed for selective checking
3. Update `$schema` to match the new version

## Alternative: Import Organization

Since `assist` is not available in 2.2.4, import organization can be triggered via CLI:
```bash
biome check --assist-enabled=true --write
```
