## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
When pushing task-2 from Chargeback-StagingApp-WebClient to Jira, the operation fails with error: 'undefined is not an object (evaluating result.fields.summary)'. The Jira API response after issue creation is missing expected fields or the response structure is not being handled correctly.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Investigate the Jira issue creation response structure in the push code
- [ ] #2 Add proper null/undefined checks for result.fields.summary
- [ ] #3 Handle missing fields gracefully with appropriate error messages
- [ ] #4 Test push operation with task-2 from webclient repository successfully
