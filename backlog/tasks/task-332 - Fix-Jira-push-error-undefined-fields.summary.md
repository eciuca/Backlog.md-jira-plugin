## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
When pushing task-2 from Chargeback-StagingApp-WebClient to Jira, the operation fails with error: 'undefined is not an object (evaluating result.fields.summary)'. The Jira API response after issue creation is missing expected fields or the response structure is not being handled correctly.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Investigate the Jira issue creation response structure in the push code
- [x] #2 Add proper null/undefined checks for result.fields.summary
- [x] #3 Handle missing fields gracefully with appropriate error messages
- [ ] #4 Test push operation with task-2 from webclient repository successfully
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Review the createIssue response handling in jira.ts
2. Add null/undefined checks for result.fields before accessing nested properties
3. Add proper error handling with informative messages
4. Ensure the JiraIssue object is constructed safely
5. Test with a real push operation
6. Document the fix

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
## Issue Identified

The `createIssue` method in `src/integrations/jira.ts` was not handling response validation properly. The code assumed that `result.fields.summary` and other nested properties would always exist, but the Jira MCP response structure can vary.

## Changes Made

Enhanced the `createIssue` method with comprehensive validation:

1. **Response Type Validation**: Added check to ensure the response is an object
2. **Required Fields Validation**: Validate that `key` and `id` are present
3. **Fields Object Validation**: Check that the `fields` object exists before accessing it
4. **Safe Property Access**: Use optional chaining (`?.`) for nested properties
5. **Fallback Values**: Provide sensible defaults when fields are missing:
   - `summary`: Falls back to input summary if response doesn't have it
   - `status`: Falls back to "Unknown"
   - `issueType`: Falls back to input issueType
   - `created`/`updated`: Fall back to current timestamp

## Code Location

File: `src/integrations/jira.ts`, lines 1066-1115

## Error Messages

The fix adds three types of error messages:
- "Invalid response from jira_create_issue: not an object"
- "Invalid response: missing key or id"
- "Invalid response: missing fields object"

All errors are logged with context (projectKey, issueType, result) for debugging.

## Testing Note

AC #4 requires testing with task-2 from webclient repository, which should be done by the user since it requires access to that specific repository and its tasks.
