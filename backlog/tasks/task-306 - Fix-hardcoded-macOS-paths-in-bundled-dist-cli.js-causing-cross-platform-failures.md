## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The Bun bundler is embedding absolute macOS paths into the dist/cli.js bundle, specifically for thread-stream and pino modules. When the package is installed on Linux, these hardcoded paths like '/Users/eciuca/workspace/...' cause ModuleNotFound errors because they don't exist on other machines. Lines 3860 and 4281 in dist/cli.js contain these hardcoded __dirname values that break cross-platform compatibility.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Identify why Bun is hardcoding absolute paths for __dirname in thread-stream and pino modules
- [x] #2 Research and test solutions: either mark pino/pino-pretty as external dependencies, use different bundler options, or replace with alternative logging solution
- [x] #3 Implement the fix in build configuration (package.json or separate build script)
- [x] #4 Verify dist/cli.js no longer contains any hardcoded macOS paths (grep for /Users/eciuca)
- [x] #5 Test the bundled CLI works correctly on both macOS and Linux environments
- [ ] #6 Publish new version to npm and verify 'backlog-jira init' works on Linux after global installation
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Research Bun bundler options to prevent hardcoding __dirname
2. Test marking pino and pino-pretty as external dependencies
3. If external doesn't work, research alternative solutions:
   - Using a different bundler (esbuild, rollup)
   - Replacing pino with a simpler logger that doesn't use worker threads
   - Using Bun's --define flag to replace __dirname
4. Implement the chosen solution in build configuration
5. Rebuild and verify no hardcoded paths remain
6. Test on macOS and Linux (or in Docker container)
7. Update version and publish to npm
8. Verify the fix with fresh npm install on Linux

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Fixed by marking pino and pino-pretty as external dependencies in the build script.

The issue was that Bun bundler was inlining thread-stream and pino modules and hardcoding the __dirname to the absolute path on the build machine (/Users/eciuca/workspace/...). This caused ModuleNotFound errors on Linux because those paths don't exist.

Solution: Added --external pino --external pino-pretty flags to the build command. This tells Bun not to bundle these modules, so they are resolved from node_modules at runtime instead.

Verified:
- No hardcoded paths in dist/cli.js (grep confirms)
- CLI works correctly on macOS
- Logger functionality is working (pino is loaded from node_modules)

Next: Test on Linux to ensure cross-platform compatibility

Testing results:
- All 139 runtime tests pass
- CLI works correctly on macOS (tested locally)
- CLI works correctly on Linux (tested in Docker with node:20-alpine)
- Logger functionality verified (pino loaded from node_modules)
- Build produces smaller bundle (0.75 MB vs previously larger)

Note: TypeScript type checking shows 101 pre-existing errors in test files, not related to this change. These are mocking issues that don't affect runtime behavior.

Ready for publishing to npm as version 0.1.4

Next steps for AC #6 (Publishing):
The prepublishOnly script includes type checking which currently fails due to 101 pre-existing test mock errors. Options:
1. Temporarily disable type checking in prepublishOnly for this release
2. Publish manually with: npm publish --otp=<code>
3. Fix the type errors first (would require updating all test mocks)

Recommendation: Publish manually since runtime tests pass and the fix is verified to work on both macOS and Linux.
