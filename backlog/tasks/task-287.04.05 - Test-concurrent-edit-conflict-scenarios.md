## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Verify that concurrent edits to the same task on both Backlog and Jira sides properly trigger conflict detection and resolution (AC #7 of task 287.04)
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Simulate concurrent edits in test environment
- [x] #2 Verify conflict detection triggers for simultaneous changes
- [x] #3 Test all conflict resolution strategies with concurrent edits
- [x] #4 Verify snapshot updates prevent false conflicts
- [x] #5 Test race conditions in sync operations
- [x] #6 Document concurrent edit handling behavior
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Review existing sync test patterns in sync.test.ts to understand current coverage
2. Identify gaps in concurrent edit testing based on AC requirements
3. Design test scenarios for concurrent edit conflicts:
   - Simultaneous updates to same field
   - Simultaneous updates to different fields
   - Race conditions in snapshot updates
   - Different conflict resolution strategies with concurrent edits
4. Implement comprehensive test suite:
   - Test concurrent title/summary changes
   - Test concurrent description changes
   - Test concurrent status changes
   - Test concurrent assignee/priority/label changes
   - Test snapshot update timing to prevent false conflicts
   - Test race conditions in sync operations
5. Verify all conflict resolution strategies work with concurrent edits:
   - prefer-backlog
   - prefer-jira
   - prompt
   - manual
6. Document concurrent edit handling behavior in code comments
7. Run tests and fix any issues
8. Mark all acceptance criteria complete

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented comprehensive test suite for concurrent edit conflict scenarios

## Changes Made:

### New Test File: `backlog-jira/src/commands/sync-concurrent.test.ts`
Created a dedicated test suite with 32 comprehensive tests covering all acceptance criteria:

#### AC #1: Simulate concurrent edits (7 tests)
- Test concurrent changes to title/summary
- Test concurrent changes to description
- Test concurrent changes to status
- Test concurrent changes to assignee
- Test concurrent changes to priority
- Test concurrent changes to labels
- Test concurrent changes to multiple fields simultaneously

#### AC #2: Verify conflict detection (4 tests)
- Classify as Conflict when both sides changed
- Prevent false conflicts when only one side changed
- Handle same-field concurrent edits
- Handle identical changes (edge case)

#### AC #3: Test resolution strategies (6 tests)
- prefer-backlog strategy
- prefer-jira strategy
- prompt strategy (marks for manual resolution)
- manual strategy
- Apply prefer-backlog to all conflicting fields
- Apply prefer-jira to all conflicting fields

#### AC #4: Verify snapshot updates (4 tests)
- Update snapshots after successful sync
- No conflict detection after snapshots updated
- Prevent false conflicts from stale snapshots
- Handle snapshot update timing correctly

#### AC #5: Test race conditions (5 tests)
- Handle rapid successive syncs
- Handle concurrent push and pull operations
- Handle snapshot reads during updates
- Maintain consistency across multiple task syncs
- Handle sync state transitions correctly

#### AC #6: Documentation (6 tests)
- Document 3-way merge approach
- Document snapshot-based change detection
- Document conflict resolution strategies
- Document field-level conflict detection
- Document snapshot update timing
- Document race condition handling

## Test Results:
✅ All 32 tests pass
✅ 71 expect() calls executed successfully
✅ Tests follow the Testing Style Guide patterns

## Key Features Tested:
- 3-way merge conflict detection using base snapshots
- Field-level conflict detection for: title, description, status, assignee, priority, labels
- All four conflict resolution strategies
- Snapshot management and atomic updates
- Race condition handling in concurrent operations
- False conflict prevention through snapshot-based comparison

## Testing Approach:
- Used mock-based testing for isolation
- Simulated realistic concurrent edit scenarios
- Verified both positive and negative cases
- Documented expected behavior in test descriptions
- Tests serve as living documentation of conflict handling
