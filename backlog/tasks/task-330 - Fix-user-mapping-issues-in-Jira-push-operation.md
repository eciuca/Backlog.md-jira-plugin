## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The backlog-jira push command is failing due to two related issues: 1) Unable to find account ID for user 'eciuca', and 2) Undefined error when accessing result.fields.summary during Jira issue creation. Need to implement proper user account ID resolution and improve error handling.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 User account ID lookup is working correctly
- [ ] #2 Error handling gracefully handles missing or invalid user mappings
- [ ] #3 Jira issue creation succeeds with proper field validation
- [ ] #4 Push operation provides clear error messages for user mapping failures
<!-- AC:END -->
