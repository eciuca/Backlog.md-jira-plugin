## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The backlog-jira pull command successfully completes the operation and shows 'Pull Results' but doesn't exit cleanly - it continues running and blocks the terminal, requiring Ctrl+C to exit. The operation itself works correctly (task-289 was successfully pulled from S20-291), but the process should terminate automatically after showing the results.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Pull command exits cleanly after displaying results
- [ ] #2 No manual Ctrl+C required after successful pull
- [ ] #3 Process terminates with proper exit code (0 for success)
<!-- AC:END -->
