## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The configure test performs a connection check that may fail initially but has a retry mechanism. Currently, errors are shown on first failure which can be confusing. The test should only display errors if the connection fails after all retry attempts are exhausted.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Errors are suppressed during retry attempts
- [x] #2 Final error is shown clearly if all retries fail
- [x] #3 Success message appears immediately on first successful connection
- [x] #4 Retry mechanism behavior is preserved
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented silent mode feature for JiraClient to suppress transient connection errors during retries:

- Added `silentMode` option to `JiraClientOptions` interface
- Modified `ensureConnected()` to suppress console output and reduce logging during retry attempts when in silent mode
- Updated `createDockerTransport()` to conditionally display Docker command based on silent mode
- Modified `configure.ts` to enable silent mode during connection testing

Files modified:
- src/integrations/jira.ts: Added silent mode support
- src/commands/configure.ts: Enabled silent mode for connection tests

The implementation ensures that:
1. Errors during external server fallback to Docker are logged at debug level in silent mode
2. Docker command console output is suppressed in silent mode
3. Final errors after all retries are still properly thrown and handled by the caller
4. Success messages appear immediately when connection succeeds
