## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The configure test performs a connection check that may fail initially but has a retry mechanism. Currently, errors are shown on first failure which can be confusing. The test should only display errors if the connection fails after all retry attempts are exhausted.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Errors are suppressed during retry attempts
- [ ] #2 Final error is shown clearly if all retries fail
- [ ] #3 Success message appears immediately on first successful connection
- [ ] #4 Retry mechanism behavior is preserved
<!-- AC:END -->
