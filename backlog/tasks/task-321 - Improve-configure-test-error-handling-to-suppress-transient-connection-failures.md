## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The configure test performs a connection check that may fail initially but has a retry mechanism. Currently, errors are shown on first failure which can be confusing. The test should only display errors if the connection fails after all retry attempts are exhausted.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Errors are suppressed during retry attempts
- [ ] #2 Final error is shown clearly if all retries fail
- [ ] #3 Success message appears immediately on first successful connection
- [ ] #4 Retry mechanism behavior is preserved
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Locate and analyze the configure test and its connection check logic
2. Identify where errors are currently displayed during retries
3. Modify error handling to suppress errors during retry attempts
4. Ensure final error is shown clearly after all retries fail
5. Verify success message appears immediately on first connection
6. Test the changes with both success and failure scenarios
